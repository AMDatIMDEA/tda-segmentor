# tda-segmentor
A segmentation tool for the analysis of porous structures 
using the TTK toolkit (https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/)

### Installation Instructions
Compiling the tda-segmentor code should be done in two steps :

* Install the ttk library from source.
* Compile the tda-segmentor code linking the ttk library.

##### Installing the Topology Toolkit (TTK)
* TTK must be installed from the source code and detailed instructions
  can be found here (https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/installation.html)
* To install TTK from source, first Paraview must be compiled from sources, 
  and on a linux machine it is recommended to install ParaView-v5.9.1
  while on a Mac machine it is recommended to install ParaView-v5.10.1
* Once Paraview is installed, to install TTK, we must use the developer version 
  of TTK directly from the GitHub repo (https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk) 
  using the following commands :
  * ** git clone https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk.git **
  * Next we checkout to a certain commit :
     * ** git checkout 6ff3c19c210a38b17e08f265279fa753d3673366 **
  * The above code will be the source code for installation.
